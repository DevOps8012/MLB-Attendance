# Baseball

I've scraped attendance data for all 30 MLB teams over a 25 year period (1990 - 2014) and created a few predictive models. All of my code is available within this repository, and an explanation of my work is available at [r-directory](https://r-dir.com/blog/2015/02/predicting-baseball-game-attendance-with-r.html).

Data sources are [Baseball-Reference.com](http://www.baseball-reference.com/) & Wikipedia.
